# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict students' academic performance using various machine learning models. By analyzing factors such as demographics and prior scores, the system provides insights into potential student outcomes.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates student performance based on input features. This can aid educators and institutions in identifying students who may need additional support.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Modeling Techniques:** Multiple regression models with hyperparameter tuning

## 📁 Repository Structure

* `notebook/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development
* `src/`: Source code for data processing and model training
* `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface
* `app.py`: Flask application to serve the model
* `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bharath143-vk/StudentPerformance_ML.git
   cd StudentPerformance_ML
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 📊 Features

* Predicts student performance based on user input
* Supports multiple machine learning models
* Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
* Simple and interactive web interface

## 📈 Results

After training and evaluating multiple models, the best-performing model achieved an R² score of 0.87, indicating a high level of accuracy in predictions.
